#### Overview

The app created for this project is a simple to-do list utility. The user can add and remove lists containing to-do items, which can be added or removed from each list.

---

#### Requirements

Your app must:

- **Display a collection of to-do lists**
- **Display items on each to-do list, including descriptions**
- Allow the user to **create a new to-do list**
- Allow the user to **Add items** to each to-do list
- Allow the user to **remove items from a to-do list**
- Allow the user to **remove an entire to-do list**
- Use two custom Java classes to contain your data for each `ToDoList`, and the `ToDoItem`s in each `ToDoList`
- Show an error message if invalid input is given (e.g. blank input)
- Persist data (your `ToDoList`s) while the app is open using a **singleton**
- Use either `ListView` or `RecyclerView` to show your `ToDoList`s and `ToDoItem`s. We recommend `RecyclerView`, but will accept `ListView` for this project.
- Display correctly in both landscape and portrait orientations

**Bonus:**

- Allow the user to check off completed items
- Allow the user to edit previously added items
- Persist data when the app closes and is re-opened

---

#### Necessary Deliverables

- A **git repository hosted on GitHub**, with frequent commits dating back to the **very beginning** of the project. Commit early, commit often.
- **A ``readme.md`` file** describing what the app does, and any bugs that may exist
- At least one screenshot of your home screen in the `readme.md`
- Pictures of your prototypes in the git repository
